# Project Management: Bifrost Bridge

## Workflow

All work follows a standardized Kanban-style lifecycle:

1. **Backlog**: Tasks are logged in `docs/backlog/` or as issues.
2. **Planning**: Decisions documented in `implementation_plan.md` and approved.
3. **Execution**: Code implemented in feature branches.
4. **Verification**: Validated via tests and `walkthrough.md`.

## Commit Standard

Use descriptive commit messages:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Infrastructure/maintenance
