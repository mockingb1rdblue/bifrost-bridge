## Architecture & Components

### Layer 1: Network Liberation

**MCP Server Proxies**
- Cloudflare Workers that proxy Model Context Protocol servers (Linear, GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Bypass corporate SSL inspection by terminating connections at Cloudflare's edge
- OAuth flow handling for services that require authentication
- Request/response logging for debugging corporate filtering rules

**API Gateway Proxies**
- Transparent proxies for OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Google AI APIs
- Rate limiting and cost tracking (corporate networks often have unpredictable latency)
- Automatic failover between direct connection and proxy routes
- Request sanitization (strip corporate proxy headers that leak information)

**Certificate Management Toolkit**
- Antigravity-powered automated certificate extraction from corporate MITM proxies
- Batch certificate harvester that visits common dev domains and exports full chains
- Certificate validator that tests which certs are needed for specific tools
- Auto-configuration scripts that inject certificates into Node.js, Python, Git, npm, etc.

### Layer 2: Development Environment Portability

**Portable Runtime Manager**
- Node.js portable setup (no installer, no admin, PATH auto-configuration)
- Python portable distributions with pip working out-of-the-box
- Git portable with credential helpers for corporate SSO
- VS Code / Cursor portable mode with extension sync via personal cloud storage

**OneDrive Performance Workarounds**
- Intelligent symlink manager (moves node_modules outside sync, maintains references)
- Git sparse-checkout templates (exclude heavy directories from OneDrive)
- Build cache redirector (Vite, esbuild, tsc output goes to local disk)
- Auto-detection of OneDrive paths with warnings and migration scripts

**NPX & Package Management**
- Offline package cache manager (pre-download on unrestricted network, transfer via USB/personal cloud)
- Corporate registry auto-detection and configuration
- Dependency lock freezer (prevent surprise updates that might require new approvals)
- npx execution wrapper that respects NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS even through spawned processes

### Layer 3: AI-Assisted Network Archaeology

**Corporate Environment Detector**
- Antigravity agent that automatically probes network topology
- Discovers which APIs/services are blocked, throttled, or require proxies
- Identifies SSL inspection, captures corporate CA certificates
- Tests PowerShell execution policies and suggests Bash/Node alternatives
- Generates a detailed "restriction fingerprint" for your specific employer

**Live Network Testing Dashboard**
- HTML dashboard (generated by Antigravity) showing real-time API accessibility
- Color-coded status for each service (direct, via proxy, blocked, slow, working)
- Historical latency graphs (corporate networks degrade unpredictably)
- Automated testing that runs periodically and alerts to policy changes

**Configuration Generator**
- Based on network detective results, generates working configs for:
  - npm/yarn/pnpm (registry, proxy, certificate settings)
  - git (proxy, SSL verification, credential helpers)
  - MCP servers (proxy URLs, auth handling)
  - Environment variables (NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, HTTP_PROXY, etc.)
- One-command setup for new machines or after corporate policy updates

### Layer 4: Development Workflow Acceleration

**Cloudflare Workers Development Kit**
- Templates for proxying any service behind corporate firewall
- Local development via Wrangler (no admin needed)
- Deployment scripts that work from restricted networks
- D1 database templates (serverless SQL when corporate DB access is blocked)
- R2 storage templates (file uploads when OneDrive is the only option)

**Fly.io Remote Development Environment**
- One-click deployment of full dev environments on Fly.io machines
- VS Code Remote SSH configs that work through corporate proxies
- Database hosting (PostgreSQL, Redis) when local Docker is impossible
- Build servers (heavy compilation offloaded to machines with proper bandwidth)

**Discord/Collaboration Tools Integration**
- Webhook-based bot patterns (no persistent WebSocket that corporate firewalls drop)
- Cloudflare Workers gateway for Discord API (avoid direct connection issues)
- OAuth flow handlers for corporate SSO-wrapped services
- Message queue patterns for unreliable corporate network connections

### Layer 5: Documentation & Knowledge Base

**The Corporate Survival Guide**
- Comprehensive documentation of common corporate restrictions and solutions
- Decision trees: "Getting error X? Try solution Y, if that fails, try Z"
- Video walkthroughs (recorded by Antigravity during testing) showing exact steps
- Troubleshooting database indexed by error messages, corporate IT vendors (Zscaler, Palo Alto, etc.)

**Community Contributions**
- Template for documenting your specific corporate environment's quirks
- Anonymous submission of "this worked at Company X" tips
- Corporate IT policy parser (extract restrictions from Confluence/SharePoint docs)
- Legal/HR compliance notes (what's actually forbidden vs. just hard)
