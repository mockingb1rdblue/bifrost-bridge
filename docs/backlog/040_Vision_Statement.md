## Vision Statement

**Bifrost Bridge** is the rainbow bridge connecting developers trapped behind corporate firewalls to the open internet's full development ecosystem. Named after the mythological bridge linking mortal and divine realms, it transforms hostile corporate network environments from career-limiting obstacles into mere inconveniences.

Like its namesake, Bifrost Bridge stands as a guardian and gateway—it doesn't fight the corporate infrastructure, it transcends it. Through intelligent proxying, automated certificate management, portable tooling, and AI-assisted network archaeology, it gives developers back their autonomy to build modern software in decidedly non-modern corporate environments.
