**Yes, you can set up a portable PowerShell and add it to your user PATH on Windows.** This works best with PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe), which offers official ZIP archives for no-install, side-by-side use without affecting the built-in Windows PowerShell 5.1. Download the latest ZIP (e.g., PowerShell-7.5.3-win-x64.zip) from the GitHub releases page, extract it to a folder like C:\PortablePowerShell, and run pwsh.exe directly from there.
