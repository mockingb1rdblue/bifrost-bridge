## The Solution

Bifrost Bridge is a comprehensive toolkit that embodies the principle: **competence over compliance**. Instead of asking permission or fighting IT policies, it provides elegant technical solutions that work within the constraints while achieving full functionality.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Transparency Through Indirection** - Route restricted traffic through legitimate channels (Cloudflare Workers, Fly.io, personal infrastructure)
2. **Portability Over Installation** - Everything runs without admin rights, from user directories, using npx and portable executables
3. **Automation Over Manual Repetition** - AI agents (Antigravity) handle the tedious work of certificate extraction, network testing, and configuration
4. **Documentation Over Gatekeeping** - Every workaround is explained, reproducible, and shareable
5. **Adaptability Over Rigidity** - The toolkit learns from your specific corporate environment and adapts its strategies
