## The Problem

Modern development requires unfettered access to APIs, package registries, cloud services, and collaboration tools. Corporate IT departments, however, deploy:

- **SSL inspection** that breaks certificate validation for development tools
- **Proxy servers** that block or throttle API endpoints
- **Admin restrictions** that prevent installing necessary software
- **PowerShell execution policies** that disable automation scripts
- **OneDrive forced sync** that destroys node_modules performance
- **Network restrictions** that blacklist entire cloud platforms

Developers are caught between two incompatible realities: the tools and services they need to be productive, and the security apparatus designed to prevent exactly that productivity. The result is hundreds of hours wasted fighting certificate errors, smuggling portable executables, and routing around restrictions—all while feeling like criminals for trying to do their jobs.
