## Enhanced Vision

Transform Linear into a **full DevOps command center** where every issue tracks not just the work, but the entire software delivery lifecycle: commits, CI/CD runs, deployment status, rollback capability, and post-mortem learnings. Issues become living documents that capture "what worked, what didn't" for future reference and team learning.
