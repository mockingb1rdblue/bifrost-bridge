## Setup Steps

Download the ZIP for your architecture from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases (e.g., x64 or arm64). Extract to your chosen portable location, such as C:\PortablePowerShell—unblock the ZIP first with Unblock-File if needed to avoid execution issues. Test by navigating to the folder and running .\pwsh.exe; it launches independently without system changes.
