## Setup

1. Get Linear API key (single team access is fine)
2. Set team ID
3. Deploy MCP server or use directly in code
4. Integrate with Antigravity agents
```

This gives you **programmatic control over your entire Linear workspace** while making Antigravity the intelligent project manager that understands context, dependencies, and project structure. [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linear/sdk/v/1.6.0)
