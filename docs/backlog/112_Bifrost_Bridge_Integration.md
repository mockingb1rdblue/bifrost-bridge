### Key Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail** - Every issue has full history of what was tried
2. **Automated Release Management** - From milestone to production with one command
3. **CI/CD Visibility** - Pipeline status directly in Linear issues
4. **Intelligent Labeling** - AI suggests appropriate labels, lifecycle auto-updates them
5. **Git-Flow Integration** - Branch naming, release notes, GitHub releases all automated
6. **Learning Organization** - "What didn't work" captures institutional knowledge
7. **Zero Manual Updates** - Antigravity agent handles all status/label/comment updates

This transforms Linear from a task tracker into a **full DevOps intelligence system** that learns from every deployment, failure, and success. [linear](https://linear.app/developers/graphql)
