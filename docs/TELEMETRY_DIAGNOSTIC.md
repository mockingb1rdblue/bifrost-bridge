# Swarm Telemetry Diagnostic Report (2026-02-16)

## 🎯 Objective
Establish a reliable, persistent telemetry stream from the **Sluagh Swarm** to the **Event Store (Annals of Ankou)** on Fly.io to enable real-time visibility into autonomous task execution.

## 🛑 Problem Statement
The Sluagh Swarm was operational but "blind." The Event Store (`annals-of-ankou`) was crashing immediately upon startup on Fly.io, preventing any events from being recorded. Simultaneously, the orchestrator (`crypt-core`) was returning `401 Unauthorized` errors when manual synchronization was triggered.

## 🏗️ What Was Tried & Results

### 1. Fly.io Process Monitoring
- **Attempt**: Checked `fly logs` and perceived immediate process exits.
- **Hypothesis**: Port binding or entrypoint mismatch.
- **Action**: Removed `require.main === module` guard and forced `start()` on load. Added "🚀 BOOTSTRAP" logging.
- **Result**: Process started reaching the database initialization phase but then crashed with a `SQLITE_ERROR`.

### 2. Database Initialization & Migrations
- **Attempt**: Analyzed the crash logs.
- **Discovery**: `SQLITE_ERROR: duplicate column name: topic`.
- **Root Cause**: The `initDB()` function was not idempotent. It attempted to `ALTER TABLE` even if the column already existed in the volume-persisted SQLite database.
- **Fix**: Refactored `db.ts` to check `PRAGMA table_info` before attempting migrations, wrapped in `try/catch`.

### 3. Orchestrator Secret Synchronization
- **Attempt**: Triggered manual sync via `curl`.
- **Discovery**: Received `401 Unauthorized`.
- **Root Cause**: `recover-secrets.sh` was using `--env production` for Cloudflare Workers. However, the workers were deployed to the **default/top-level** environment. Cloudflare was creating separate, non-functional workers named `*-production`.
- **Fix**: Corrected `recover-secrets.sh` to use `--env ""` (targeting top-level) and resynced all keys.

### 4. Machine State Recovery
- **Attempt**: Restarted Fly.io machine `178104edfde6d8`.
- **Discovery**: Machine would go to `stopped` state after hitting max restart count due to previous failures.
- **Action**: Manually started the machine and confirmed `INFO Preparing to run: docker-entrypoint.sh npm start`.

## ⚠️ Persistent Blockers
- **Network Latency**: High TTL on sync requests suggests the orchestrator is still struggling to reach the Fly.io endpoint or is timing out during the deep Linear sync.
- **Volume Lock**: Intermittent "database is locked" errors during rapid deployments may occur due to Fly.io's volume handling during machine restarts.

## 🛠️ Current Status & Recommendation
- **Event Store**: Successfully patched and listening on port 8080. Migration logic is now safe.
- **Orchestrator**: Secrets are aligned.
- **Next Action**: Run `npx wrangler tail crypt-core` to verify the exact error if the sync trigger continues to hang.
